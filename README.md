# Legal AI Demo

## Overview  
This project is Assignment 1 for **Legal AI: Design and Development (LAWS90286)** at Melbourne Law School. The main functionality allows users to interact with a legal AI by uploading a document and asking questions about the content.

## How to Use

1. **Upload a Document**  
   Upload a legal document or any file you wish to inquire about. The system will analyze the document's content to help answer any questions related to it.

2. **Ask Questions**  
   You can ask a question about the uploaded document. The AI will generate responses based on the document's content.

3. **Continuous Interaction**  
   You can ask follow-up questions to maintain an ongoing conversation.

4. **Download Q&A**  
   After interacting with the system, you can download the complete set of questions and answers for further reference.

## A Test Case

1. **Upload**  
   Upload the file `test_sample/ADJR_5.txt`, which contains the first five sections of the **ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS (JUDICIAL REVIEW) ACT 1977**. This file focuses on the first five sections for testing to save computational resources.

2. **Initial Question**  
   Ask the following question:  
   `I think the government has taken an irrelevant consideration into account in the exercise of a power. What should I do?`

3. **Follow-up Question**  
   After receiving a response, ask the follow-up question:  
   `Do I have standing to sue?`
